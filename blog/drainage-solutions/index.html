                <p class="lead-paragraph">Proper drainage is the foundation of successful mountain landscaping. Poor drainage leads to erosion, foundation damage, plant death, and costly repairs. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about managing water on sloped mountain properties.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Mountain Drainage Challenges</h2>
                <p>Mountain properties face unique drainage issues that differ significantly from flat terrain. Water moves rapidly downhill, concentrating flow and creating erosion. Heavy snowmelt in spring can deliver months' worth of precipitation in weeks. These factors require specialized drainage solutions.</p>

                <h3>Common Drainage Problems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sheet erosion:</strong> Thin layers of topsoil washing away across entire slopes</li>
                    <li><strong>Gully formation:</strong> Concentrated water flow carving deep channels</li>
                    <li><strong>Foundation undermining:</strong> Water flowing beneath structures, causing settling</li>
                    <li><strong>Wet areas and soggy zones:</strong> Poor drainage creating unusable muddy spaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Downstream flooding:</strong> Excessive runoff impacting lower areas of property</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Professional Drainage Assessment</h2>
                <p>Before implementing solutions, conduct a thorough drainage assessment. This involves observing your property during different conditions—after rainstorms, during snowmelt, and in dry periods.</p>

                <h3>What to Look For</h3>
                <p>Walk your property during a rainstorm (safely). Watch where water flows, where it pools, where it moves fastest. Take photos. Note problem areas. This field observation is more valuable than any plan or map.</p>

                <h2>Drainage Solutions for Mountain Properties</h2>

                <h3>1. French Drains</h3>
                <p>French drains are perforated pipes buried in gravel-filled trenches. They intercept subsurface water and direct it to appropriate discharge points. Essential for wet areas, foundation protection, and redirecting groundwater.</p>
                <p><strong>Installation:</strong> Dig trenches following property contours, line with filter fabric, add gravel base, install perforated pipe (holes down), cover with gravel, wrap fabric over top, backfill with soil.</p>

                <h3>2. Swales and Berms</h3>
                <p>Swales are shallow channels that slow and redirect water. Berms are raised areas that divert flow. Together, they manage surface water without pipes or structures.</p>
                <p><strong>Design tip:</strong> Swales should have gentle grades (1-2%), planted with native grasses to slow water and prevent erosion. Berms direct water into swales or away from structures.</p>

                <h3>3. Dry Creek Beds</h3>
                <p>Dry creek beds are attractive features that double as drainage channels. They handle occasional heavy water flow while looking natural year-round.</p>
                <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Excavate channel, line with filter fabric, place large anchor stones, fill with graduated river rock, edge with native plants. Size appropriately for peak water volume.</p>

                <h3>4. Retaining Walls with Drainage</h3>
                <p>Retaining walls on mountain properties must include proper drainage to prevent water pressure buildup behind walls.</p>
                <p><strong>Critical elements:</strong> Weep holes at base, gravel backfill behind wall, filter fabric to prevent soil clogging, perforated pipe at wall base to collect and route water.</p>

                <h3>5. Terracing</h3>
                <p>Terracing breaks long slopes into series of flatter areas. Each terrace slows water, reduces erosion, and creates usable spaces.</p>
                <p><strong>Design:</strong> Terrace width depends on slope angle—steeper slopes need closer spacing. Each level should slope very slightly back into hillside to prevent water flowing over front edges.</p>

                <h3>6. Rain Gardens</h3>
                <p>Rain gardens are planted depressions that capture runoff, allowing it to infiltrate slowly. They filter pollutants, reduce erosion, and create beautiful planted areas.</p>
                <p><strong>Plant selection:</strong> Choose species tolerant of both wet feet (during storms) and drought (between rains). Native plants work best.</p>

                <h3>7. Catch Basins and Downspout Management</h3>
                <p>Roof water concentrates quickly. Downspouts must discharge to appropriate locations—never directly against foundations or onto slopes prone to erosion.</p>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Underground pipes to daylight locations, splash blocks with rock aprons, rain barrels for capture and slow release, integration with dry creek beds.</p>

                <h2>Erosion Control Techniques</h2>

                <h3>Immediate Erosion Control</h3>
                <p>For areas actively eroding, immediate action prevents further damage. Erosion control blankets, straw wattles, and silt fences provide quick temporary protection while permanent solutions are installed.</p>

                <h3>Long-term Erosion Prevention</h3>
                <p>Permanent erosion control comes from proper grading, strategic planting, and structural solutions. Deep-rooted native plants stabilize soil. Properly designed drainage prevents concentration of water flow.</p>

                <h2>Material Selection</h2>

                <h3>Drainage Pipe</h3>
                <p>Use corrugated HDPE pipe for flexibility around rocks and roots. Rigid PVC works for straight runs. Always use proper pipe size—undersized pipes fail during peak flows.</p>

                <h3>Gravel and Rock</h3>
                <p>Use clean angular gravel (not round pea gravel) for French drain fill—it packs better and maintains void space for water flow. River rock for aesthetic dry creek beds. Filter fabric prevents soil migration into gravel.</p>

                <h2>Maintenance Requirements</h2>
                <p>Drainage systems require regular maintenance to function properly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspect after major storms for damage or clogging</li>
                    <li>Clean debris from catch basins and surface drains</li>
                    <li>Check dry creek beds for rock displacement</li>
                    <li>Monitor French drain outlets for proper flow</li>
                    <li>Maintain plantings in swales and rain gardens</li>
                    <li>Repair erosion damage promptly before it worsens</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When to Call Professionals</h2>
                <p>Some drainage issues require professional expertise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foundation drainage problems</li>
                    <li>Large-scale erosion issues</li>
                    <li>Retaining wall drainage</li>
                    <li>Properties with springs or high water tables</li>
                    <li>Complex grading projects</li>
                    <li>Drainage systems requiring permits</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Effective drainage management protects your investment and creates a healthy, functional landscape. While some solutions are DIY-appropriate, many mountain drainage projects benefit from professional design and installation. The cost of proper drainage is always less than repairing damage from poor drainage.</p>
